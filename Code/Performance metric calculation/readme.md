# performance_metrics

R code used to obtain dynamic area and dynamic noise of a mean-noise pointset. Briefly, the concave hull of the log10 transformed pointset is converted to a polygon object. Dynamic area is computed as the antilog of the area of the hull. Next, a vertical chord is drawn across the hull at every vertex. Dynamic noise is computed as the antilog of the longest vertical chord.â€ƒ

## Software used to run code

 R (v3.6.3)
  - ggplot2 (v3.3.0)
  - sp (v1.4-1)
  - alphahull (v2.2)
  - dplyr (v0.8.5)


## Usage
- Run code with a mean-noise pointset as in the test data "mean_noise_data.csv"
- Parameters
   - *df0*: provide path to mean-noise pointset .csv file
   - *alpha*: alpha parameter for concave hull
- Results
  - *F_A*: dynamic area
  - *F_eta*: dynamic noise
